# Sales-Analysis-by-Excel
I have data on the sales of the ice cream store during the year 2019, the manager 
need to know the answers to some of the questions to manage the shop in a better way according 
to the Accurate facts.

At first, I identified the questions that concern the manager.
Then, I took the data that was already stored in excel file.
Then, I checked the cleanliness of the data but I found it already cleaned.
Then, I start to analyze the data.
I put the results that I found in graphs to be easy for undserstanding.
Finally I suggested some ideas to the manager.
